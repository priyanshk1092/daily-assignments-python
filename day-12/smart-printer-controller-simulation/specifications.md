# üß© Smart Print Queue System

### ‚è± Duration: 1 Hour  
### üí° Difficulty: Intermediate  
### üß† Topics: Stacks, Queues, Undo/Redo Operations, OOP in Python  

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

You are designing a **Smart Print Queue Manager** for an office printer.  
The printer should process documents in **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** order,  
but also support **Undo** and **Redo** functionalities for user actions.

Your task is to build a **command-line Python program** that uses:
- A **Queue** to manage print jobs in order.
- Two **Stacks** to implement **Undo** and **Redo** operations.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functional Requirements

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Add a Print Job  
- User inputs a `document_name`.  
- The job is added to the print queue.  
- Record this action in the Undo stack.  
- Clear the Redo stack.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Cancel a Print Job  
- User specifies a `document_name`.  
- If found in the queue, remove it.  
- Record the cancel action in the Undo stack.  
- Clear the Redo stack.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Undo Last Action  
- If the last action was `add`, remove that document from the queue.  
- If it was `cancel`, re-add the canceled document.  
- Push the undone action into the Redo stack.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Redo Last Undone Action  
- Re-apply the last action undone using the Redo stack.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Show Current Queue  
- Display all print jobs currently waiting to be printed (FIFO order).

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Exit  
- Cleanly terminate the program.

## üß≠ Example Interaction

```python
=== SMART PRINT QUEUE ===
1. Add Job
2. Cancel Job
3. Undo
4. Redo
5. Show Queue
6. Exit

> 1
Enter document name: Report.pdf
‚úÖ Added 'Report.pdf' to print queue

> 1
Enter document name: Invoice.pdf
‚úÖ Added 'Invoice.pdf' to print queue

> 5
üìÑ Print Queue:
1. Report.pdf
2. Invoice.pdf

> 2
Enter document name: Report.pdf
üóëÔ∏è Canceled 'Report.pdf'

> 3
‚Ü©Ô∏è Undo: Re-added 'Report.pdf'

> 5
üìÑ Print Queue:
1. Report.pdf
2. Invoice.pdf

# üñ®Ô∏è Smart Print Queue System - Skeleton Code

## Objective
Implement a print queue manager using **Python‚Äôs Queue data structure**.  
The system should handle print jobs submitted by multiple users, prioritize urgent documents, and process them efficiently.

## üîß Skeleton Code

# üñ®Ô∏è Smart Print Queue System (with Undo / Redo / Cancel)

## üéØ Objective
Implement a **menu-driven Smart Print Queue System** using Python, demonstrating the use of **Queues** and **Stacks** together.  
The system manages print jobs, supports cancellation, and allows undo/redo of user actions.
