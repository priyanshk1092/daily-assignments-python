Problem Statement: Bank Account Management App
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are tasked with developing a command-line Bank Account Management Application in Python. 
The app should allow users to perform basic banking operations such as:

    Creating new user accounts
    Updating account details
    Viewing account details
    Depositing and withdrawing money
    Deleting accounts

Each user will have:

    Unique account number (auto-generated)
    Name
    Email
    Balance
    Account type (savings/current)

Data should be stored in a JSON file so that changes persist across sessions.

Add a PIN-based authentication system:

    User creates an account with a PIN
    User must authenticate with correct PIN for actions like deposit, withdraw, update
    PINs are securely stored (weâ€™ll use password hashing)
    Optional PIN retry limit or error handling

Directory Structure:

bank_app/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ account.py          # Account class
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ bank_service.py     # Business logic for managing accounts
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ storage/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ file_store.py       # JSON file storage
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py                 # Entry point of the app
â””â”€â”€ data/
    â””â”€â”€ accounts.json       # Data store


ðŸ§  Other optional ideas:

âœ… Save data to JSON/SQLite for persistence
âœ… Limit incorrect PIN attempts
âœ… Export/import accounts
âœ… Add transaction history
