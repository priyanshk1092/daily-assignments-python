# 🧠 Python Assessment: Multiple Inheritance

## Problem Statement
Design and implement a **Smart Home Device Management System** using **multiple inheritance** in Python.

### Description
In a smart home environment, devices such as lights, speakers, and thermostats can be controlled remotely and connected via Wi-Fi.  
Your task is to design a system that demonstrates multiple inheritance concepts using the following guidelines:

- Define a **Device** base class with attributes and methods common to all devices.
- Define a **Connectable** base class for connectivity-related functionality.
- Create derived classes like **SmartLight**, **SmartSpeaker**, and **SmartThermostat** that inherit from both `Device` and `Connectable`.
- Implement a **SmartHome** manager class to manage all devices (add, show, turn on/off, connect Wi-Fi, etc.).
- Demonstrate the use of **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**.
- Include at least one overridden method (e.g., `__str__()` or `turn_on()`).
- This is an **object-oriented programming and multiple inheritance** exercise.

### 🧠 Tasks for Students
1. Implement all `pass` methods with meaningful logic.  
2. Demonstrate multiple inheritance behavior using MRO (`SmartLight.mro()`).  
3. Use method overriding for device-specific behavior.  
4. Create at least three device instances and manage them through `SmartHome`.  
5. Display the final status of all devices.
