# Create the "guess my number" game where the user has to guess a number between 1 and 100. 
# The user has 10 attempts to guess the number. 
# After each guess, the program should tell the user 
# if the guess is too high, too low, or correct. If the user guesses the number correctly, 
# they win; otherwise, they lose after 10 attempts.
